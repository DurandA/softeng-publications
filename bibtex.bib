abstract = {Summary This paper introduces a fully decentralized low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT) using the LoRa protocol. While global LPWANs typically require roaming agreements between network providers and a trusted third party for server resolution, we propose a trustless model where the network servers are resolved using a blockchain application. Since LoRaWAN relies on symmetric cryptography, we also propose a new security model that adds non-repudiation using digital signatures. This paves the way for linking devices to decentralized applications. We finally analyze the impact of this new model on message size and energy requirements.},

abstract="In this paper we present BitWorker, a platform for community distributed computing based on BitTorrent. Any splittable task can be easily specified by a user in a meta-information task file, such that it can be downloaded and performed by other volunteers. Peers find each other using Distributed Hash Tables, download existing results, and compute missing ones. Unlike existing distributed computing schemes relying on centralized coordination point(s), our scheme is totally distributed, therefore, highly robust. We evaluate the performance of BitWorker using mathematical models and real tests, showing processing and robustness gains. BitWorker is available for download [1] and use by the community.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) has grown in recent years to a huge branch of research: RFID, sensors and actuators as typical IoT devices are increasingly used as resources integrated into new value added applications of the Future Internet and are intelligently combined using standardised software services. While most of the current work on IoT integration focuses on areas of the actual technical implementation, little attention has been given to the integration of the IoT paradigm and its devices coming with native software components as resources in business processes of traditional enterprise resource planning systems. In this paper, we identify and integrate IoT resources as a novel automatic resource type on the business process layer beyond the classical human resource task-centric view of the business process model in order to face expanding resource planning challenges of future enterprise environments.",

abstract="An Integrated Electronic Book (IEB) represents a complex network of integrated information and ``know how'' on a given subject. In the design phase of WEBS (Woven Electronic Book System), we soon realized that, because we were describing the IEB in terms of ``objects'' and ``methods,'' and because we wanted WEBS to be easily expandable and to offer a consistent user interface, we should use an object-oriented development system.",

abstract="IRAP3 is a model, method and results base system, written in FORTRAN, whose purpose is to offer to the reliability engineer a whole set of methods to analyse system reliability. Through a simple command language he can define, store and modify interactively reliability models. He can ask IRAP3 to perform computations on them and to store the results.",
